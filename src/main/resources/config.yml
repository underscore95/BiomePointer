# Note that higher values will increase lag, although will make the Biome Pointer better at locating biomes. (and possibly too op)
# cache-distance must be greater than search-distance, both values must be greater than 100
search-distance: 2000 # If the plugin doesn't already know about a biome then it will search for one within this distance of the player
cache-distance: 5000 # If the plugin already knows about a biome, the Biome Pointer will only point towards the biome if it's within this distance of the player

# Note that while the Biome Pointer can locate non-overworld biomes, compasses cannot point towards them.
